# campaign-season

In your ongoing efforts to participate in the local tech community, you've joined a group called U Develop It. This group meets regularly to discuss new developments in web technology. By participating, you can meet peers, collaborators, mentors, and even future employers.

## U Develop It is starting a new fiscal year, and it's time to pick a new president.

Of course, the group is developing its own app for voting. Some members have already started building the front end of the application, but they need volunteers to build the back end.

## The back end will consist of a relational database behind an API.

You already know how to create an API with Express.js, so you've volunteered to join the back-end development team. This will be a great opportunity to learn about databases!

The back-end team has settled on using MySQL for the database. As a relational database, it excels at storing and retrieving records that are related to each other—like candidates, their parties, and members' votes. Like most relational databases, MySQL is queried using Structured Query Language, or SQL. Learning SQL will serve you well in your career because other popular relational databases also use SQL, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. MySQL is a popular database choice for both small and large projects because it is easy to configure, secure, reliable, and open source. It also runs on almost any operating system.

## ON THE JOB

SQL has remained popular since its creation in 1970. Through numerous generations of technology, many enterprise applications have entrenched themselves in SQL databases due to their centralized security, scalability, and ability to handle numerous concurrent requests. As one of the most sought-after skills by recruiters, SQL is a powerful language that's used in a majority of databases in every economic sector, from manufacturing, logistics, and health care to insurance, commerce, and much more.

## Use MySQL to create a database.
